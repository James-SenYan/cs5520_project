<h1>Post for code lab 2.1</h1>

<h2>what I've learned:</h2>

> - I can assign my activity implementations a parent/child relationship by setting parentActivity in AndroidManifest.xml so as to enable up navigation in my app.

> - Explicit intents and implicit intents can invoke another action in my app.

> - Data like URL can be stored in intents. If I want to sent additional information via intents, intents extras are helpful.

> - Hence, I can create and launch another activity in my app and send data to it meanwhile. Moreover, back data can be processed by overriding onActivityResult() method.
