<P>To make our application show properly in horizontal orientation as well as various devices with different dimentions, different layout variants are essential.</p>
<p>Linear Layout arranges elements in a row vertically or horizontally. During finishing homework, I enountered difficulties in changing background colors of buttons. I tried to change colors by hardcoding android:background. However, it didn't work. I found out this is caused by a contradiction between themes.xml and activity.xml. In themes.xml, I set primary color to purple. Hence, valid solution to change background color is using android:backgroundTint="color" rather than android:background="color" </p>
