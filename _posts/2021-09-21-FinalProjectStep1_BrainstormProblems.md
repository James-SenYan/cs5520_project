# think about 50 problems for my final project: show steel prices on app. My father is a merchant in steel industry.

## <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu/senyan/cs5520_project/tree/hw2/ImplicitIntents">Further exploration of three problems.</a>

## 50problems
>- Accounting for this is a commercial application, contacts and infomation of company are shown at the bottom of the page.

>- There is a price table consisting of prices of items within latest 7 seven days.

>- where does those price data come from? 

>- This could be tricky since it's a website data mining problem. Hopefully, I can find a website publishing prices.

>- Prices are dynamic which means that I should write a data mining program refreshing in a short intervals.

>- Customers might want to know price of only one item. Hence, there should be a filter on the page which customers can use to select items they want to purchase.

>- We can't deny the fact diagrams are more intuitive than tables when showing trends of prices.Hence, there should be a show  diagram button in the page.Another activity showing diagram pops up when users click that button in order to transit to diagram mode.

>- Actually a lot of sales employees in steel industry in China use social media to advertise. They post current prices to social media so as to advertise. This is less intuitive and inefficient. Customers could become annoying when seeing many ads on social media platform.

>- Owing to the fact that steel industry is rather traditional, customers always make a call to ask price. However, they can get access to them directly with this application.

>- Actually my father has a warehouse to store different commidities made from steel such as triangle steel, steel plate etc.Showing remaining amount of goods in his warehouse is equivalently important.

>- Hence, price as well as stock should be contained in a table.

>- Users should be notified after placing their orders.Here comes the email system.

>- A order consisting of information of customers and items is sent via email system. I'm wondering if I could use exsiting email system to address this problem.

>- Order information can be divided into two parts.Information of customer: name, phone number, address.Another part is about items:name of item, amount of item.

>- What's the purpost of this application: The main purpose of my application is to provide users with price changes instantly.

>- In the end, how would this application look like.

>- Contents for this application.

>- Who will this application target at? 
>- Are the users female, male or neutral?

>- How many services are provided in this application.

>- Among those services available, which are key services?

>- Which service would users use most frequently?

>- The first problem I need to address when developing app.

>- As for the exterior, which service is displayed at the home page?

>- What's the primary color for my application?

>- To make this product successful, what should I do to promote website visits.

>- How long would this application take to develop.

>- Consider what kinds of platforms should this application support.
>- Night mode is supported.

>- Is there a similar app that I can refer to.

>- What are the good ideas of those similar apps that we can learn from.

>- What are the negative points of those apps that we should avoid.

>- What kind of style do I want?
 
>- What are the essential elements of your design?

>- Which age group is the product aimed at?

>- Waht basic knowledge should users have so as to use this app.

>- Should this application have a logging in process? Hence, we can get contact information from users.

>- Where should I keep data like user information: phone numbers, email address.

>- Usually each order is about thousands of dollars. Hence, users might want to pay such amount by bank application. We don't need to add payment service in our application.

>- Users are likely to go the warehouse. It's important to provide an implicit intent to lauch map activity so as to provide address navigation.

>- The key thing of a successful application is that it should provide users with fantastic using experience. I should consider cache important data in order to make using experience smooth.

>- The difference between platforms is also something that needs to be considered in the design of mobile app products. 

>- For example, Android and iOS systems, iOS is done through gestures, and Android sometimes has physical buttons, so you need to understand your target users when designing. What type of cell phone.

>- Come up with a idea to make this application compatible as much as it could be.

>- Mobile devices are limited in sizes, I should make sure images and words are easy to recognize.

>- Conform behaviors of this app with others so as to avoid users becoming confused.

>- What problems will my application help users to address?

>- How to attract users to reuse this application after a while?

>- How to make this application more generic? I could add this application to a larger project working as a module.

>- Should I make full use of widgets of mobile phones like built-in GPS, camera, barometer, accelerometer?
