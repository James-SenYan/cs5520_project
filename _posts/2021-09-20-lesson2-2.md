## What I've learned:
>- I can add Log statements to MainActivity by overriding methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy(). These statements helps me to observe activity lifecycle changes.

>- It's of vital importance to implement onSaveInstanceState() method to save activity instance states in case unexpected destroy and recreation. This method is invoked between onPause() and onStop() process.

>- Details: instance states are stored in a bundle via putString(), putBoolean() etc..

>- I can restore activity instance states via extracting data from Bundle savedInstanceState in onCreate() method.

## Questions: 

1. If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device? Choose one: C
	- The EditText no longer contains the text you entered, but the counter is preserved.
	- The counter is reset to 0, and the EditText no longer contains the text you entered.
	- **The counter is reset to 0, but the contents of the EditText is preserved.**
	- The counter and the contents of the EditText are preserved.


2. What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs? Choose one: C
	- Android immediately shuts down your Activity by calling onStop(). Your code must restart the Activity.
	- Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(). Your code must restart the Activity.
	- **Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().**
	- Android immediately calls onResume().

3. When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called? Choose one: A
	- **onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.**
	- onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onResume() method.
	- onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onCreate() method.
	- onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onDestroy() method.

4. Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed? Choose one: A
	- **onPause() or onStop()**
	- onResume() or onCreate()
	- onDestroy()
	- onStart() or onRestart()
