## What I've learned:
> - In explicit intents I should specify activity class name to tell it to address my intent.However, in an implicit intent, I just specify action and data for that action. Actions include ACTION_VIEW (to view the given data), ACTION_EDIT (to edit the given data), or ACTION_DIAL (to dial a phone number). 

> - Android system will search all intent filters of different activities and find one suitable for handling the intent.For example, google browser is activated when the intent aims to browse website or google map is launched when the intent wants to find a location etc.. If there is more than one available Activity, the system provides a chooser so the user can pick one.

> - Launching a chooser if necessary when several activities are suitable for handle a intent. ShareCompat.IntentBuilder is a well- built class for designing a chooser.
