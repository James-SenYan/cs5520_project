<P>Learn how to basically use Android Studio via Hello World app. Lesson1.1 aims to help us set up Android Studio and get familiar with this tool.</p>
<p>The key part is to edit activity_main.xml file which acts like a index.html on website in _layout directory. Probably should there exist a way to manage MainActivity.java since it could become verbose when a large number of methods are added?
In order to manage resources, we need to extract colors, string names, dimentions etc. form activity_main.xml file.
AVD is short for Android Virtual Device.</p>

<h2> Homework answers </h2>
<ol>
  <li>What is the name of the layout file for the main activity?    C:activity_main.xml
</li>
  <li>What is the name of the string resource that specifies the application's name?    A:app_name
</li>
  <li>Which tool do you use to create a new emulator?   B:AVD Manager</li>
  <li>Assume that your app includes this logging statement:
Log.i("MainActivity", "MainActivity layout is complete");
You see the statement "MainActivity layout is complete" in the Logcat pane if the Log level menu is set to which of the following? (Hint: multiple answers are OK.)
     Verbose, Debug, Info</li>
</ol>
