<p>
Add view elements to the layout which is a constraint one hence generating a view group. The most wonderful point I want to say about Android Studio is that it provides developers with both preview editing mode and plain code editing mode. Wrap_content and match_constraint attributes are useful in adjusting sizes of elements.

<p>Methods for handlers are required to be added in MainActivity.java while android:onClick property should be included in activity_main.xml</p>
<p>Toast is a class in Java which is used as a small popup window to show a message. Java is object-oriented in which all elements are created by classes and manipulated by its methods. In order to get references to elements in main layout, I should invoke findViewById() within onCreate method</p>
